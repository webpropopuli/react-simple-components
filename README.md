```https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-4d490abc349c```

Converting from CodePen to local. So far, so good. Used create-react-app and it just works/

1) The like/Hate thing is wrong. I know how to do it one way but what I'm trying won't work and I don't know why.

2) Can't figure out yet how to get stopPropagation or preventDefault to work on these virtualized elements. I know I'm just a line of code away....
